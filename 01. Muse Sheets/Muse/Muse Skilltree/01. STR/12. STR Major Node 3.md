- Absolute Rampage: Your combat experience has turned you into an unstoppable weapon, capable of great destruction. You gain the ability to perform two actions per turn, +2 to your STR (up to a maximum of 20), and permanently increase your max HP by 10.
- - Titanic Aura: Your compatriots are in awe of your might, and will fight tooth and nail to ensure victory. Every ally that’s considered a part of your Team gains +1 AC (to a max of 3), gains advantage on STR checks, cannot be frightened, and gains a temporary 10 HP upon the start of a Confrontation. You gain similar benefits in and out of battle. This Perk is in effect for as long as you’re standing.
    
- Infinite Hyperfury: Visions of death and losing everything you’ve worked for consumes your being, activating an ancient rage. It will take the very Gods to put you down. Once per Escapade, when your STR reaches 0, you don’t die. Instead, you gain back 20 HP, deal an extra +3 damage with all abilities/items, and gain advantage on STR checks and STR Saves. You are immune to being paralyzed, stunned, charmed, frightened, and restrained. You cannot be healed in this state. Once the encounter ends, you go unconscious and must rest for a full day.

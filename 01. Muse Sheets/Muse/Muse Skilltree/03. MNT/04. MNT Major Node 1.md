- Detective’s Hunch: Sometimes a gut feeling is all it takes. Once per day, whenever you’re investigating a location, an item, or tracking a creature, you can choose to invoke this Perk. When you make an investigation roll with this Perk active, you will be led to a piece of information that will help you and is not misleading (GM’s choice).
    
- Mind Fortress: Your mind is steeled and ready to defend itself against intruders. You take -3 damage from psychic attacks, and you have Advantage on Saves against being Charmed.
    
- Purity: Your magical capabilities save those around you. Choose one healing ability/item. That ability/item is now capable of dispelling the Poisoned, On Fire, and Freezing status effects from up to 2 creatures, even if the ability/item is single target.

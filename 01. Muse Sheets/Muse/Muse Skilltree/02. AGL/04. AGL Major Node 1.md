- Not Today: Your nimble body lets you get away in critical situations. Once per Escapade, you can force the enemy to reroll their damage against you. If the second, rerolled number is higher than the first number, the first number is applied like normal.
    
- Out in the Open: Revealing your position is usually a bad call, but it does give you a better shot. When attacking with ranged weapons, you can choose to invoke this Perk and gain +6 to your damage roll, at the cost of the next attack against you having Advantage and dealing an extra +3 damage.
    
- Close Contact: You know sometimes itâ€™s better to get up close and personal. You no longer have disadvantage when firing at creatures within melee range.

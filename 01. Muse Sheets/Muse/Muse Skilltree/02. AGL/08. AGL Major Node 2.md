- I Can Dodge Bullets?: Once per Round, you can reduce the damage of an incoming physical, ranged attack by d10 + AGL modifier + rank.
    
- Piercing Shots: Choose to increase either STR or AGL by +1. Once per round, you can reroll any of your damage die. If the rerolled number is lower than your initial roll, you can apply the initial roll’s damage as usual.
    
- Closing In: When victory is in sight, you know how best to ensure it doesn’t slip away. When attacking a creature whose HP has been reduced to half of their max HP, you can now add additional damage equal to your MNT modifier.

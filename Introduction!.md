I've never needed to make documentation before  and I don't exactly know what to put here. Almost everything you could need to change is in the settings... I don't think anything will break easily because I haven't put in anything overly complicated yet but I also know next to nothing about canvasses, which the character sheets are currently set up under.  Good luck! ^-^ 

There are templates that will fill out automatically for new notes created under certain folders. You can adjust the templates under the maintenance folder. 
You can link files together for whatever reason by going ``[[this is the name of what i would link]]`` [[Introduction!]] <- Like that.

- Genuine Falsehood: Trust goes a long way, especially when one side believes it’s never been lied to, not once. When you attempt to deceive a creature during a conversation and fail, you can choose to immediately reroll your dice and take the better result. You may only do this once per conversation. If you succeed, the creature will not be aware it’s been lied to.
    
- Born This Way: Stardom was always your calling. You gain Advantage when performing, as well as the favor of humans who might’ve been neutral towards you.
    
- Fearsome Threat: You know how to scare those who threaten you. When a creature is threatening you with a weapon and about to attack, you may choose to intimidate them into dropping their weapon and running away from the confrontation outright. Gain +1 to SCL.

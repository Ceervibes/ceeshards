- Snap out of it!: Your words cut through the noise and bring the lost back to reality. You can attempt to save a creature from the Frightened or Charmed effects with your words by making a speech. Roll a SCL Check. If the creature is someone you know well, you make the check with Advantage. If itâ€™s just an acquaintance, you gain no Advantage.
    
- Aspiring Leadership: You know exactly what to say to get your fellow fighters ready for battle. You may invoke this Perk once per round. Choose up to 2 creatures and make a rousing speech. Afterwards, the chosen creatures gain the Inspired status effect. Until the end of your next turn, they can choose to reroll any of their dice rolls.
    
- Crass Tactics: Words can often hurt just as much as sticks and stones. You gain the ability to use your speech against enemy creatures who can understand you. Make a SCL Check and throw an insult at the targeted enemy. If the Check is successful, the affected enemy has Disadvantage imposed on their attacks for their next 3 turns. If the Check is unsuccessful, the enemy gains Advantage and +1 to damage when targeting you for their next 3 turns.

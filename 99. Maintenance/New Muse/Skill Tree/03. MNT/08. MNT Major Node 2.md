- Of Many Faces: It’ll take time to figure out who you actually are. When using a disguise of any kind, creatures who attempt to see through your disguise have Disadvantage on the roll. Additionally, you gain a +1 to AGL.
    
- Swifthax: Low-security technology is a no-brainer for you. When attempting to hack simple technology (sliding doors, TVs, fridges, vacuum robots, etc.), you are not required to make a check and simply perform the action. Additionally, you gain a +1 to MNT.
    
- Nature’s Calling: You give to the woods, so the woods give to you. You gain +2 to investigation, animal handling, and survival checks when outdoors and away from major human settlements. Additionally, most critters and bugs are automatically friendly to you.

- Tough Guts: Making you vulnerable is no easy task. When a creature is attempting to paralyze, poison, or frighten you, you gain an advantage on the associated Save. Increase your STR by +1.
    
- I’m Here: Selfless sacrifice is the mark of a hero. When you take the defend action against an allied creature, and should that creature be attacked, you gain +1 AC. Additionally, inspired by your bravery, the person you defended gains +3 damage on their next attack.
    
- With Everything I’ve Got: Desperate times call for desperate measures. You willingly put yourself into a bad position and strike with all you have. Once per Escapade, you may use this Perk to deal the maximum possible damage with your ability/item. The next two attacks dealt against you gain Advantage and +2 damage.
